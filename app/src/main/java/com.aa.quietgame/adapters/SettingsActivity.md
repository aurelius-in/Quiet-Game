### Basic outline of what the SettingsActivity.java might include for the Quiet Game app.

- The SettingsActivity would be responsible for providing the user with a way to customize their game settings. Here are some possible features that could be included in the SettingsActivity:

- Avatar selection: Allow the user to select their avatar from a list of pre-loaded images or images stored on their device.
- Background selection: Allow the user to select the background theme of the game.
- Sound effects: Allow the user to toggle sound effects on or off.
- Leaderboard privacy: Allow the user to choose whether to share their scores on the leaderboard or keep them private.
- Reset game data: Provide an option for the user to reset all game data, including profiles and scores.
- The SettingsActivity would need to be linked to the rest of the app so that any changes made by the user are reflected in the game.
